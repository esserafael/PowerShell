# PowerShell
A collection of PowerShell scripts, tools and modules that I've developed during the years (some for fun, most for making my life easier). From the most basic functions to very specific tasks.
Feel free to use or fork them. 
Any issues, please let me know.

PS: The repository is still quite empty, I'm in an effort to adapt everything to a "more public" or clean version.
